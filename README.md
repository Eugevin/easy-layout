[DEPRECATED]

Reson: I wrote this thing a long time ago for workers at an old job. I think that all of them are already using more sophisticated tools and there is no need to use such an outdated builder

# For what

_For easy build and write code for your HTML, CSS and JavaScript project with pug (jade), autoprefixer, babel, hot-reload, bootstrap
and normalize.css_

## How to use

_First you need to clone this repository on your local pc via `git clone`_

_Run `npm i` in console to install all dependencies of project_

_Now we have two commands: `npm run dev` for development job and `npm run build` to compress and compile your files in one build folder_

_You can add new npm packages to your project with `npm i [package name]` and connect it into project via `import` in `./src/index.js`_

_If you want to create new `.pug` file in `./src/pages` folder, you need do the restart of webpack compiler!_

## Here we go

_Thx for using this_ ðŸ’˜
